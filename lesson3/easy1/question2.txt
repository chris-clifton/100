Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:
- The ! preceding a boolean or = sign means to do the opposite.  !true means false.  != means not equal to.
- The ! following a method means the action is modifying/mutating the object.  
- The ? is used in ternary operations
  ex: condition ? (execute if true) : (execute if false)


What is != and where should you use it?
-- != tests nonequivalency and is conditionals and loops.

Put ! before something, like !user_name
--
put ! after something, like words.uniq!
put ? before something
put ? after something
