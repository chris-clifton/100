# input: string of space separated words
# output: hash 
# rules: hash outputs different lengths of words and then the occurrences of that length
# algorithm: 
# iterate over string and count each word's length
# each unique "length" should be a key in the new hash 
# each word that matches that length should increment the value by 1
