Madlibs Revisited
Let's build another program using madlibs. A %{noun} made a program like this in the %{adjective} exercises. 
This time, the requirements are %{adverb} %{adjective}.

Make a %{adjective} program that reads in some %{adjective} text from a text file that you have created, and 
then plugs in a selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into that text and %{verb} it. 
You can build your lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs directly into your program, but the text 
data should come from a file or other %{adjective} source. 

Your program should %{verb} this text, and for each line, it should place random words of the appropriate types into the text, and %{adverb} print the result.
The challenge of this program isn't about %{verb}ing your program; it's about choosing how to represent your %{noun}. 
Choose the %{adjective} way to structure your data, and this problem becomes %{adverb} easier. This is why we don't 
show you what the input data looks like; the %{noun} representation is %{adverb} your responsibility.
