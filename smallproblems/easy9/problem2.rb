# A double number is a number with an even number of digits 
# whose left-side digits are exactly the same as its right-side digits. 
# For example, 44, 3333, 103103, 7676 are all double numbers. 444, 334433, 
# and 107 are not.

# Write a method that returns 2 times the number provided as an argument, 
# unless the argument is a double number; double numbers should be returned as-is.
